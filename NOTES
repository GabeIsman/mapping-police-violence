Census provides place-level shapefiles (at pretty low resolution). These could be combined with census place-level race/population statistics to get some very granular data. With this info it would be possible to do likeliehood of getting killed by police by city (if not exactly police district).
I am not doing this to start out with because of the added complications of downloading and stitching together all of these maps/data
