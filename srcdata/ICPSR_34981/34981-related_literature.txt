Presents final counts on prisoners under the jurisdiction of state and
federal correctional authorities on December 31, 2012, collected in the
National Prisoner Statistics Program. The report expands on the statistics
presented in the advance report in July 2013. It includes tables on the
number of noncitizen inmates, inmates under age 18 in the custody of state
or federal prisons, and prison capacity for each state and the Federal
Bureau of Prisons. It also focuses on trends in prison admissions and
releases from 1991 to 2011 and the offense and demographic characteristics
of yearend prison populations. The report examines data from California
state prisons between 2010 and 2012, one year prior and during the
implementation of the state's Public Safety Realignment policy.

Summarizes data from various correctional collections to provide statistics
on the number of offenders supervised by the adult correctional systems in
the United States. Adult correctional systems include offenders supervised
in the community under the authority of probation or parole agencies and
inmates held in state and federal prisons or local jails. The report
examines the size and change in the total correctional population, the
impact of changes in the community supervision and incarcerated populations
during 2012, and the declining rate of offenders under correctional
supervision over the past 5 years. The report also describes the impact of
the California Public Safety Realignment Act of 2011 on changes in
California's correctional populations and its broader impact on the U.S.
correctional populations. Appendix tables provide additional information on
other correctional populations, including prisoners under military
jurisdiction, inmates held by correctional authorities in the U.S.
territories and commonwealths, and jail inmates held in Indian country
facilities.
